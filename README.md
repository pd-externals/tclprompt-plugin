enabling the Tcl/Tk prompt
==========================

When developing GUI-plugins (or debugging Pd) it often helps
to have a little interactive Tcl/Tk prompt within Pd.

This plugin adds enables one for you.

Currently it simply enables the Tcl prompt built into pd-gui
(since Pd-0.47 it can no longer be enabled from within Pd).
